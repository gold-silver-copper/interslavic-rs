# Changelog

**Policy — variant order is API.** Multi-byform cells are `" / "`-joined
strings and consumers bless first-variant outputs into their expectations:
reordering variants is a breaking change and must be called out explicitly
in the release notes (fenced by `tests/variant_order.rs`).

## 0.12.0 — 2026-07-21

Capability-and-contract release from the completed mrzavec integration:
numeral count government, dictionary metadata exposure, per-case
preposition senses, a whole-dictionary output fingerprint, and the
downstream integration guide. Spelled-out numerals are deliberately out
of scope (steen recommends digits; downstream renders digits).

### Added

- **`quantified(n, lemma, case, gender, animacy)`** /
  `quantified_with_info(…, plural_only)`: the correctly-governed noun
  form for a counted phrase (`n` rendered as digits by the caller).
  Steen's base rule is cited (1 → nom sg, 2–4 → nom pl, 5+ → gen pl);
  the compound-numeral rule (value-based, no East-Slavic last-digit
  rule), the Nom/Acc-only genitive override, and the animate-accusative
  genitive are documented policy — the sources are silent and the docs
  say so. Plural-only nouns take collective government (gen pl, "dvoje
  novin", never *"dvě noviny"); detection is automatic for dictionary
  lemmas, explicit via `quantified_with_info` for OOV pluralia tantum
  (steen's own example `dveri` is not a dictionary row).
- **`verb_info()` / `noun_info()`** with `Aspect`
  (`Ipf`/`Pf`/`Biaspectual`) and `Provenance` (`Dictionary`/`Guessed`):
  the metadata the dictionary carries but never exposed. The extractor
  now records perfectivity, reflexivity, and intransitivity per row
  (mirroring `@interslavic/utils` `parsePos`: a biaspectual `ipf./pf.`
  row is imperfective AND perfective); the conjugation booleans keep
  their historical semantics untouched. Doc-tests pin the downstream
  audit answers: `hybiti` is `v.intr. ipf.`, `ukrasti` `v.tr. pf.`,
  `abstrahovati` biaspectual.
- **`preposition_senses()`**: each governed case with its English gloss
  (`s+Gen` "off, down from" vs `s+Ins` "with…"), sourced from the steen
  prepositions page with dictionary translations where steen has no
  entry, source-marked per entry; unit-tested to agree with
  `preposition_cases` case-for-case.
- **Whole-dictionary paradigm fingerprint**: 533,286 cells (noun,
  adjective, raw verb, numeral, and closed-class pronoun paradigms)
  hashed (inline FNV-1a) and pinned in a unit test. `cargo xtask
  dump-paradigms [name]` writes the dump; `cargo xtask diff-fingerprint
  <old> <new>` prints the exact cell delta, making the changelog
  enumeration for any deliberate change mechanical.
- **`INTEGRATION.md`**: the downstream guide (citation forms, the
  byform-order contract, clean vs `_raw`, pronoun styles, counting,
  metadata, the never-post-process rule, slovowiki cross-check caution,
  a verified runtime-assembly example), linked from the README and
  lib.rs.
- Parity harness: a **numeral scope** driven by dictionary rows (every
  `num.*` row via `declensionNumeral` across the full
  case/number/gender/animacy grid): 129 paradigms / 7,308 forms, 100%
  compatible (3 byform rows skipped where the reference returns null).

### Changed

- `decline_numeral`/`numeral()` now cover the whole numeral inventory.
  Changed cells vs 0.11.0 (all enumerated; numerals were in no previous
  parity scope): the animate accusatives of `dva`/`oba`/`obydva`
  (`dva` → `dvoh`) and `tri`/`četyri` (`tri` → `trěh`), and the neuter
  nominative/accusative of the dva-family, which was `dva` and is now
  correctly `dvě` (feminine AND neuter, per steen and the reference).
  Everything else is additive (`None` → `Some`): `obadva`, the
  collectives (`dvoje` → `dvojih`…), `nula`/`sto`/`tysęć`/`milion`/
  `miliard`, the declinable hundreds (`dvěstě`…`devęťsȯt`),
  indeclinable `-sto` byforms, the `-desęt` tens, `sedm`/`osm`, and
  `-ina`/`-ka` fractionals/substantivized numerals. Note the widened
  shape-based recognition also affects same-shaped non-numeral input,
  which previously returned `None`: an `-sto` noun (`město`) now hits
  the indeclinable-hundreds rule and an `-ero` noun (`jezero`) the
  collective rule — pass nouns to the noun API, not `numeral()`.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-07-21

Follow-up release from the mrzavec zero-pre-inflection conversion: one
confirmed bug, two ergonomics items, one contract fence, one parity-scope
extension. Existing parity numbers are byte-stable; the one intentional
output change is enumerated below.

### Fixed

- **`l_participle` diverged from the paradigm on d/t-stem `-sti` verbs**
  (`ukrasti` gave `ukrasla`; the parity-verified paradigm path gives
  `ukradla` — same for `krasti`, `pasti`, `sěsti`, `vesti`, `gnesti`).
  The facade never did the dictionary lookup, so it had no present-stem
  hint, and the hint is what recovers the dental stem. The stem
  derivation is now genuinely shared (`stem_context` in core), the
  facade resolves the hint like `verb()` does, and a self-consistency
  sweep locks the invariant: all 3,859 embedded dictionary verb lemmas ×
  six gender/number cells (23,154 cells) agree with the l-participle
  inside `verb_forms`' perfect cells — 0 divergent.
- `active_participle` leaked the internal `ĵ` marker into declined forms
  for `-aj` stems (`dělaĵųća` → now `dělajųća`); fixed by the surface
  cleaning below.

### Changed

- **`verb_forms`/`try_verb_forms` cells are now surface-ready**: the
  builders' internal intervocalic-j marker `ĵ` is flattened to `j`.
  Exactly two fields ever carried it (dictionary-wide sweep): the
  `imperative` (5,433 cells, e.g. `počivaĵ` → `počivaj`) and `prap`
  (1,597 cells, e.g. `počivaĵųćí…` → `počivajųćí…`). Variant structure,
  gender-form conventions, and citation accents are unchanged. The
  previous marker-carrying cells remain available via the new
  `verb_forms_raw()`/`try_verb_forms_raw()`, and
  `verb_forms_with_metadata` stays raw — it is the parity/integration
  entry point, and the JS reference itself emits the marker (which is
  why the parity numbers are unaffected). slovowiki's exporter (218
  tests) verified green against the new default: its `clean_cell`
  already flattens via `cells::variants`, so its output is unchanged.

### Added

- **`perfect_parts()`** (facade) / `verb::perfect_parts_with_hint`
  (core): the perfect tense as data — `PerfectParts { auxiliary:
  Option<String>, participle: String }`. The auxiliary is
  `Some("jesm"/"jesi"/"jesmo"/"jeste")` in the 1st/2nd persons and
  `None` in the 3rd (the standard normally omits it; the emphatic
  `je`/`jest`/`sųt` is the caller's to add). The participle comes from
  the same shared stem context as the compound tenses, so the accessor
  can never disagree with the paradigm.
- Parity harness: an **out-of-vocabulary verb scope** — a fixed sample
  of plausible non-dictionary lemmas per class (`-jati`, `-nųti`,
  `-ovati`, prefixed `-sti`), membership re-checked each run — tracks
  the hintless rule-engine path: 12 lemmas / 612 forms, 100% compatible.
- Variant-order fence: `tests/variant_order.rs` pins byform order for a
  representative cell per declension class, and the changelog gains the
  policy line above.

### Notes

- The `stajati` question is settled against the parity reference: the JS
  implementation does **not** contract OOV `-jati` presents (`stajaje,
  staja`; even `dajati` gives `dajaje, daja`, never `daje`), so this
  crate keeps `stajaje`. *(Correction, post-release: this note originally
  claimed slovowiki's form index carried `staje` as `prez.3jd.` of
  `stajati` and diverged from the parity standard. That was a folded-key
  homograph misreading: slovowiki's `staje` record is the noun `staja`
  — gen.sg/nom.pl/acc.pl — and it has no `stajati` verb record at all,
  so it never took a position on the contraction. When attributing a
  slovowiki form-API hit, read the record's `lemmas`/analyses fields
  before crediting it to a lemma.)*

## 0.10.0 — 2026-07-20

Additive API release closing the gaps found by the mrzavec runtime-inflection
audit. Existing noun/adjective/verb behavior is byte-stable (verified by the
sonic16x parity harness at the same commit and dictionary snapshot).

### Added

- **Personal and reflexive pronouns** (`interslavic_core::pronoun`, new):
  complete closed-class paradigms for `ja`/`ty`/`on`/`ona`/`ono`/`my`/`vy`/
  `oni`/`one` and the reflexive `sebe`, following the `@interslavic/utils`
  3.4.0 `declensionPronoun` reference (documented discrepancies with the
  steen legacy table in the module docs). The three form series are explicit
  via the new `PronounStyle` enum: `Full`, `Clitic` (exactly the attested
  set: `mę`/`mi`, `tę`/`ti`, `go`/`mu`, `sę`/`si`), and `AfterPreposition`
  (the 3rd-person prepositional n- forms: `njego`, `njemu`, `njim`, `njej`,
  `njih`, …). Facade: `personal_pronoun()`, `reflexive_pronoun()`; bare
  personal lemmas also route through `pronoun()` (`pronoun("ty", Case::Gen,
  …)` → `tebe`).
- **`l_participle()`** on the facade: the gender/number-marked l-participle
  (`pisal`/`pisala`, `šėl`/`šla`, `ubil`/`ubila`) for fixed-gender past
  subjects.
- **`passive_participle()` / `active_participle()`** on the facade: the
  `pfpp`/`prap` participles declined as adjectives (`"komnata jest
  osvětljena"`), with the `Option` handling and lemma normalization in one
  place. Round-trip tested across the `-ny`, `-ty`, and iotated `-jeny`
  shapes.
- Parity harness: a pronoun scope comparing every personal/reflexive cell
  (198 forms across the three series, including cell nonexistence) against
  `declensionPronoun` — 100.0000% exact; reported in the README accuracy
  table alongside nouns/adjectives/verbs.
- Doc-tests pinning downstream-assumed behavior: `svoj` via the moj-class
  path, `comparative()` pairs for `bystry`/`blizky`/`dobry`/`silny`/`slaby`,
  populated imperative/gerund for the `-ati`/`-iti`/`-ovati` classes, and
  oblique forms of `dva`/`tri`/`pęť`.

### Fixed

- `interslavic_core::verb::l_participle` is rebuilt on the same stem
  derivation the paradigm's compound tenses use, fixing three bugs in the
  old standalone implementation: the `idti` special case had singular and
  plural swapped (every singular returned `šli`), prefixed non-regular
  verbs dropped their prefix (`pojesti` → `jedl` instead of `pojedl`), and
  the `žegti`/`idti`-stem alternations were missing (`žegla` instead of
  `žgla`).
- `decline_pronoun("oni", …)` previously fell through to the adjectival
  shape branch and declined `oni` as an adjective; it now returns the
  personal-pronoun forms (`jih`, `jim`, …).

### Notes

- Slovowiki cross-check of the generated pronoun forms: all full forms
  analyze as known except the instrumentals (`mnojų`, `nami`, `vami`,
  `jimi`, `jejų`, `tobojų`, `sobojų`), which are missing from slovowiki's
  own form index (its dictionary rows list them); all clitics known; the
  n- forms are absent from its index as expected.
- The noun parity count moved from 8 to 17 mismatches between measurements
  due to edits in the live upstream dictionary sheet (soft-o loans like
  *adadžo*, substantivized adjectives); reproduced identically on 0.9.0 at
  the same sonic commit — upstream data drift, not an engine change. The
  harness noun threshold is relaxed one notch (0.9999 → 0.9998).

## 0.9.0 — 2026-07-19

- Root API refactor; see git history.
